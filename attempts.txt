@gianluca:
-fourier transform doesnt look helpful
-it would be nice to have class priors.. 
-neural networks are a waste of time
-ldc, gaussian kernel sigma=30, mean_err = 5.32%, var_err = 0.22
-fisher, gaussian, sigma=23, mean_err=3.78, var_err = 1;
-fisher, smoothed, gaussian, '23', mean_err=3.2, var_err = 0.003
-fisher, smoothed, gaussian, '30', mean_err=2.2, var_err = 0.005
