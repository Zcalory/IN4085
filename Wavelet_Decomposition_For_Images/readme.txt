Wavelet Decomposition For Images
--------------------------------------
main executing reference usage: observeWaveletDecompositionBenchmark_N_levels.m

The objective is to illustrate wavelet decomposition, and to describe how operations may be done in the wavelet domain before the reconstruction. The demo decouples the wavelet operations (transform, operation in wavelet domain, and reconstruction) from the plotting.

A PSNR and MSE describes the possible distortion (however minimal) of the forward and inverse wavelet transform.

* Caveat: The image display may be subjected to the selected target image. The objective is to provide a simple framework for the understanding of working with wavelets.


If the educational demo have more elegant presentation, please do not hesitate to suggest and send feedback to author.
